# coding_assessment

The command to run this python code is:

python caredx_cdoing_assessment.py --input sampleFile_1.txt --output results.txt

Actually, there are total 7 SNPs on the criteria (0.02 <= MAF <= 0.3) for the unrounded calculated MAF. However, in the output file we save the values by rounnding them to three decimal places, so one value of ~1.9777 rounded to 2.0 that's why it is returning the count of (0.02 <= MAF <= 0.3) to 8.
